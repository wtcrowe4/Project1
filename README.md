Web Browser Game
This is a one player Texas Hold'em game.

I created a server using express in order to use the 'phe' module for evaluation, and kept getting the same MIME type error from before.  I refactored the code I needed and put it into evaluate.js.  I left the backend stuff so I can add betting and maybe multiple players later, but you dont need to use it to see what I've got so far.

Evaluate.js was taken from thlorenz's github repo 'phe'
