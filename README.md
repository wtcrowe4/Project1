Web Browser Game
This is a one player Texas Hold'em game.

I created a server using express and kept getting the same MIME type error, so I moved the code I needed into evaluate.js and linked it straight to my page.  I left the backend stuff just in case, but you dont need to use it to see what I've got so far.


Background image was taken from Vecteezy.com, a link to their page is provided.

The large file evaluate.js is taken from thlorenz's github repository 'phe', when trying to run his node module in the browswer I was getting MIME type errors, so I moved his evaluation logic into my own javascript file.
